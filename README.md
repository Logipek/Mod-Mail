# Modmail for Discord
Modmail Bot is a bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) that allows users to DM the bot to contact the server's moderators/staff
without messaging them individually or pinging them publically on the server.
These DMs get relayed to modmail *threads*, channels where staff members can reply to and talk with the user.
To the user, the entire process happens in DMs with the bot.

Inspired by Dragory Modmail (build in eris) for the documentation and the idea. Thanks to Arvix#8443 for his handler.
